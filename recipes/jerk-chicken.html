<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a recipe that doesn't require a lot of work the day you're cooking it, 
    this jerk chicken is perfect. It marinates overnight, so the work of creating the marinade happens a day before you cook it. 
    You can even make the marinade up to a week in advance and refrigerate it.</p>

    <p>We don't recommend cooking the chicken in advance, because it will lose some of 
        its crispness and juiciness. However, if there are leftovers, refrigerate them for up to five days and eat cold. 
        Or, strip the meat from leftover jerk chicken and use it in salads.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup malt vinegar (or white vinegar)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dark rum</li>
    <li>2 Scotch bonnet peppers (or habaneros), with seeds, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 green onion tops, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme or 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons each kosher salt and pepper</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons each allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons molasses</li>
    <li>1/2 cup lime juice</li>
    <li>1 (5 to 6 pound) chicken, cut in half lengthwise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Put the vinegar, rum, hot peppers, onion, green onion tops, thyme, olive oil, salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and molasses into a blender. Pulse until mostly smooth.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken in a large freezer bag, or in a large non-reactive bowl or baking dish. Pour lime juice over the chicken and coat well.</li>
    <li>Rub the jerk paste over the chicken pieces and coat well (it helps to use gloves!). Seal the bag or cover the chicken in the pan with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat grill to medium high. Sprinkle chicken halves with salt and pepper. Place chicken halves, skin side down on the grill grates. Cover. Cook for about 40-50 minutes</li>
