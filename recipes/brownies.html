<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One day, Heather's father heard that Katharine had been in a car accident and was recovering.
     He stopped by her place to bring her a batch of brownies. Hepburn tasted them and balked. Too much flour! 
     And don't overbake them! They should be moist, not cakey! As always, 
     Katharine was opinionated and brutally honest.</p>
